# Machine-Learning
House rent predicting system using python.

This data science project helps us to walk through the steps followed during data science projects.

1)First we going to build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com
2)Second step us to create python flask server to use the saved model to serve http requests.
3)Third step is to create a app using andriod studio which allows user to enter the ares,bedrooms,etc and it will call python flask server to retrive the predicted value.

During this project almost we covered data science concepts such as,
1)Data load and cleaning,
2)Outlier detection and removal,
3)Feature Engineering,
4)Dimensionality reduction,
5)gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning,
6)k fold cross validation,

Tools and technology,
1)Python
2)Numpy and pandas for data cleaning
3)Matplotlib for data visualization
4)sklearn for data building
5)python flask for http server
6)Jupyter notebook and pycharm as IDE
7)Andriod app development for development of app
